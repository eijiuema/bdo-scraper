## Installation
```bash
npm install bdo-scraper
```

## Usage
**You can read more about the project by reading the [Docs](https://github.com/marceloclp/bdo-scraper/wiki).**

### Scraping Pages
Scraping a page is as simple as importing the correct entity scraper and calling the function.

```javascript
const { Item, Recipe, MaterialGroup, Enums } = require('bdo-scraper')

// Using ES7 async/await syntax.
async () => {
    // Returns the data for the item with id 9233.
    const itemData = await Item(9213)

    // Or, if you need it in another language, pass a different flag.
    const itemDataInPortuguese = await Item(9213, Enums.LANGS.pt)

    // You can get different types of entities by using a different Scraper.
    const recipeData = await Recipe(122)

    console.log(itemData) // Output below
}
```

This would return an object like:

```json
{
    "id":            9213,
    "name":          "Beer",
    "grade":         1,
    "icon":          "/items/new_icon/03_etc/07_productmaterial/00009213.png",
    "type":          "Special Items",
    "weight":        "0.10 LT",
    "description":   "A mild alcoholic drink brewed from cereal grains",
    "p_transaction": true,
    "prices":        { "buy": "2,150", "sell": "86", "repair": null },
    "effects": [
        "Worker Stamina Recovery +2",
        "(Use through the Worker Menu on the World Map)."
    ],
    "lifespan":      null,
    "duration":      null,
    "cooldown":      null,
    ...
}
```

### Searches

BDOScraper also supports searches now.

```javascript
const { Search, Enums } = require('bdo-scraper')

async () => {
    // Returns at most 10 of the most popular results that match the search term.
    const dataPopular = await Search('beer')

    // When passing `false` to the third parameter, all results that match the search term will be returned.
    const dataAll = await Search('beer', Enums.LANGS.en, false)

    // You can scrape the item directly from the results.
    const itemData = await dataAll[0].scrape()

    console.log(dataAll) // Output below
}
```

This would return an object like:

```json
[
  {
    "name":   "Beer",
    "id":     9213,
    "grade":  1,
    "type":   "Item",
    "link":   "/us/item/9213/",
    "icon":   "/items/new_icon/03_etc/07_productmaterial/00009213.png",
    "scrape": "__function__"
  },
  {
    "name":   "Cold Draft Beer",
    "id":     9283,
    "grade":  2,
    "type":   "Item",
    "link":   "/us/item/9283/",
    "icon":   "/items/new_icon/03_etc/07_productmaterial/00009283.png",
    "scrape": "__function__"
  },
  ...
]
```
